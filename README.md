# Commenstudio

Studios in Scratch are made first and foremost as hubs for projects. You can see in the reply limit for studios that studios being used as communities and mainly through comments is only an afterthought.

However, this also means that if you are a part of multiple such studios, you can have problems where you may miss certain comments just because you forgot to check the studio.

So, I made Commenstudio - it's a site that allows you to enter some studio IDs, and be shown all the studio comments you want at once. You can also mark comments as read, to provide a good view of what you've read and what not.

Try it out at <https://mybearworld.github.io/commenstudio/>.

I hope you find it helpful!
